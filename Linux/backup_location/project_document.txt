project documentation

1. Created sample directory structure
mkdir -p ~/project_data/{docs,images,config}
echo "Important project document" > ~/project_data/docs/document1.txt
echo "Server configuration" > ~/project_data/config/server.conf
echo "Sample image data" > ~/project_data/images/picture1.img

2. backup created 
tar -czvf project_backup_full.tar.gz ~/project_data/

3.command errored 
find ~/project_data/ -name "*.txt"
-exec tar -rvf text_files.tar {} \;
zsh: command not found: -exec

error occured because the command was split incorrectly across lines, and your shell (zsh on macOS) tried to execute -exec as if it were a new command.

correct command
find ~/project_data/ -name "*.txt" -exec tar -rvf text_files.tar {} \;
